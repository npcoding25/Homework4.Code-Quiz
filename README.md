# Code-Quiz

## Objective

* Build a functioning code quiz with a timer and have the ability to save scores

## Functionality

The code quiz begins with some text and a start button. When you click on the start button a timer will start and you'll be brought to the first question page. There are 5 total questions:
  * What does HTML do?
  * What does CSS do?
  * What does JavaScript do?
  * Which of these is a function?
  * Which of these is proper syntax for CSS?

When you click on one of the answer buttons it will bring you to the next question. If you click on the correct answer your score will increase by 1 but if you select a wrong answer your time will go down by 5 seconds. After answering the last question or running out of time you will be brought to the final page. Here you can save your initials or username and have it displayed on the screen with your final score.

### Challenges

The toughest part about the code quiz for me was making the timer function properly and saving multiple scores. I realized after i had written most of my code in javascript that i could have made an array of questions and used that to make a loop which would have shortened my code considerably. I had already spent a lot of time figuring it out this way so I did not want to change it.
